# Pasta.wtf

This is a website I made in early 2014 that hoped to address the absolutely terrible auto-marking system used to run test cases on first year Java projects (PASTA). The Pasta.wtf website is no longer running, as I could not obtain support from the relevent departments.

If you wish to run this website, you must generate SSL certs, put them in the SSL folder, and add the paths to app.js, as well as setting your IP where necessary. If you wish to be an admin, you must add your facebook ID or username (they're hardcoded, sorry, this was just a prototype after all!) in app.js.

You can then add test cases as you please, from the admin menu on the website. They are saved (and accessible) via the following hirachy: /unit/week/task

The cost (in credits) for using a test is also modifiable.
